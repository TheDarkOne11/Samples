# Sample Android application which uses Google Calendar API
This is the official [sample application](https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client-samples/tree/master/calendar-android-sample) from Google. It was recreated as a standalone Android Studio project with updated gradle settings.

It uses the Google Calendar API to get a list of users' calendars and create, delete and batch-create new secondary calendars.
